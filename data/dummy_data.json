    "conversation": "Doctor: Good morning! What brings you in today?\n\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. I've been having severe pain in my right knee for the past few weeks. It hurts when I walk or climb stairs.\n\nDoctor: I see. Have you had any injury, or did the pain start gradually?\n\nPatient: No injury, doctor. It started gradually, and now it's getting worse.\n\nDoctor: Do you feel stiffness in the morning or swelling around the knee?\n\nPatient: Yes, there’s some stiffness in the morning, and I’ve noticed mild swelling after walking for a long time.\n\nDoctor: Do you have a history of arthritis or any joint problems?\n\nPatient: No, but my father had arthritis.\n\nDoctor: Understood. I’ll need to examine your knee. Can you straighten it and bend it for me? Any sharp pain when I press here?\n\nPatient: Yes, it hurts a lot when you press the inner side of my knee.\n\nDoctor: It seems like mild osteoarthritis or possible ligament strain. I’ll recommend an X-ray to confirm. In the meantime, avoid excessive walking, apply ice packs twice a day, and take this anti-inflammatory painkiller—Tab. Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg, twice daily after meals for five days.\n\nPatient: Okay, doctor. Anything else I should do?\n\nDoctor: Yes. Do some light knee exercises and avoid squatting. If the pain persists, we may need further tests. I’ll see you again after your X-ray.\n\nPatient: Thank you, doctor!\n\nDoctor: You're welcome! Take care."
